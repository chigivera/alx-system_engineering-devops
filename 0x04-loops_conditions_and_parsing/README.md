Project Overview
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The System Engineering DevOps project aims to develop foundational knowledge in system engineering and DevOps practices, including shell scripting, Linux system management, and process automation.

In this project, you will work with shell commands, Git version control, and scripts that automate various tasks on Linux systems. The project emphasizes hands-on experience and is organized into modules covering different system engineering topics.

Features
Shell Basics: Learn and practice fundamental shell commands.
System Administration: Automate system management tasks.
Networking: Understand network concepts and configurations.
Version Control: Use Git to manage and track changes to the codebase.
Script Automation: Create and execute scripts for recurring tasks.
Prerequisites
Before working with this project, ensure that you have the following:

Linux OS or a Linux-compatible environment.
Git for version control.
Basic shell scripting knowledge (recommended).
Directory Structure
The directory structure follows specific modules for each topic covered in the course. Here’s an example structure:

plaintext
Copy code
alx-system_engineering-devops/
├── 0x00-shell_basics/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── 0-current_working_directory
│   ├── 1-listit
│   └── ...
├── 0x01-shell_permissions/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── 0-iam_betty
│   ├── 1-who_am_i
│   └── ...
├── 0x02-shell_redirections/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── 0-hello_world
│   ├── 1-confused_smiley
│   └── ...
└── README.md
Each module (0x00-shell_basics, 0x01-shell_permissions, etc.) contains its own README.md file and scripts for that topic.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/chigivera/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd alx-system_engineering-devops
Set up permissions for executable scripts (if necessary):

bash
Copy code
chmod +x ./0x*/<script_name>
Usage
Each module contains shell scripts that perform specific tasks. You can run these scripts individually by navigating to the relevant directory and executing the script.

Navigate to a module directory:

bash
Copy code
cd 0x00-shell_basics
Run a script:

bash
Copy code
./<script_name>
For example:

bash
Copy code
./0-current_working_directory
Each script’s functionality is described in its corresponding README file.
